title: Maintainer Policy and Core Contributors Governing Guidelines
---

MoveIt! core contributors and maintainers are the driving force of keeping MoveIt! alive by responding to pull requests, issues, and user questions. These two groups of highly involved participants also help fix critical regressions and support developing future versions of MoveIt!. We greatly appreciate all of the core contributors and maintainers of the MoveIt! project and thank you for your support. In addition to gratitude, some advantages of being a MoveIt! maintainer / core contributor:

 - Build up expertise of one of the most popular ROS libraries
 - Improve your resume / CV
 - Be listed on the MoveIt! website
 - Networking opportunities: gain reputation in the largest robotics community on earth
 - Quicker code contributions: you only need one review to get your code merged in, while non-maintainer/non-core contributor pull requests require two approvals.

## Core Contributors

We have a stringent process for giving commit access to the code base, but we want to have as many people involved in reviewing pull requests and responding to issues. We have a non-commit access category of MoveIt! experts we call "Core Contributors" - these participants are recognized for their hard work and contributions to MoveIt! early on. Eventually after fully proving their expertise, full maintainer/commiter status can be granted.

To be considered a "Core Contributor", we look for demonstrated excitement about the MoveIt! project. We also ask you have completed at minimum the following:

 - 2 substantial pull requests merged
 - 4 pull requests reviewed via the "Approve" or "Request Changes" button
 - 1 maintainer meeting attended

## Maintainers

MoveIt! maintainers, commonly referred to as "committers" in other open source projects, are the seasoned experts of the MoveIt! project. Becoming a maintainer is generally an invite-only process and ideally achieved by first becoming a core contributor.

### Responsibilities

Joining the Maintainer team means you have the responsibility of commit access to our Github repositories. You then can merge other's code contributions, but you should never merge your own code without someone else's review.

We've formalized the process here to disambiguate when someone should be added. We hope it's not too intimidating as we want to add as many qualified maintainers as possible:

 - Have proven a good understanding of fundamental parts of the MoveIt! code base
 - Have completed at least the minimum requirements for core contributors, above
 - Be willing to help review on average 1 pull request a week or more
 - Read the MoveIt! pull request guidelines to understand our policies
