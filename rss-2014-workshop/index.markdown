##### Murad Kurwa ([Flextronics](http://www.flextronics.com))


Title: _Factory Automation and it’s role in IoT_

**Abstract: **With the ever increasing complexity of product design, electronics manufacturing service sector and supply chain industry will be faced with more pressure to ensure advanced manufacturing techniques are utilized that result in equal or better quality and reliability of product. In addition, with rising labor cost in China and the localization and regionalization of products, automation is becoming increasingly favorable in western countries. However, automation by itself is not adequate. Some challenges that highly developed countries will face is the justification of automation relevant to labor cost and derived benefits. Hence, low cost automation including all low-cost Robots and SMART automation methodologies will be needed to realize the full potential of automation. Data from automated process linking to a company's big-data platform to be able to do analytics is equally important. Internet of Things (Iot) as it is related to manufacturing process will give rise to more and more uses of sensors both at product and factory level. Collecting discrete and batch data will suddenly make analytics at product level more interesting and will provide meaningful insights into attributes that are not commonly known. Automation will be the way IoT will become a tool beyond theories. Automation will give IoT it’s place on factory floors, in logistics center, in supply chain lanes and many more dependencies never known in the past.
Flextronics is pioneering in this space and has demonstrated the creation of such a system that will be demonstrated in the forum. Flextronics vision is to work with its customers, supply chain, consortiums, academia and partners to take the lead and setup IoT ready manufacturing cells which become the central icon to both disseminating the right information but also fast and real-time to enable pull from the point of use, allowing velocity, variability, veracity and visualization like never before.

##### Joe Romano ([Kiva Systems](http://www.kivasystems.com))


Title: _Mo' robots, mo' problems. Experiences transitioning from academia to industry_

**Abstract: **In academic research and early product development it is common to spend months or even years understanding and perfecting a single system to achieve amazing results. However, in industry there comes a time when we engineers can't be there to watch over and fix each of our individual creations. Mechanical, electrical, and software solutions that worked flawlessly in the laboratory inevitably fall prey to Murphy's law in the field. Why is it so hard to replicate our successful systems? Manufacturing variations and wear are often overlooked in research settings, but they can critically affect system performance. In this workshop I will share with you some of my own experiences, challenges, and observations moving from academic research to building lots of real-world robots (sometimes with mixed, although always entertaining, results).

**Bio: **Joe Romano received his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania's GRASP laboratory focusing on novel haptic device design and autonomous haptic sensing and manipulation strategies. Joe was part of the engineering team that brought Rethink Robotics Baxter Robot to life and now works as a Research Scientist developing next-generation platforms at Kiva Systems in North Reading, Massachusetts. Despite the challenges of building many robots, Joe still remains an undaunted optimist on the power of robots to solve all of our problems.

##### Steve Lavalle ([Oculus](http://oculusvr.com), [UIUC](http://msl.cs.uiuc.edu/))


Title: _Well..How Did I Get Here?_

**Abstract: **
You never know where your expertise, experience, and Internet presence will take you. This talk will explain how I became involved with Oculus and virtual reality, while being a robotics professor on sabbatical. An important takeaway from this talk is that our robotics background may be useful in commercial endeavors that extend well outside of robotics. This is partly due to our comfort with problems and systems that extend across multiple disciplines, such as computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. This is a natural consequence of robots mixing sensing, actuation, and computation, which furthermore gives us useful exposure to the gaps between theory and practice.

**Bio: **
Steve LaValle started working with Oculus VR a few days after its successful Kickstarter campaign and led its R&D efforts up to its $2 billion acquisition by Facebook in March 2014. He developed perceptually tuned head tracking methods based on IMUs and compute vision. He has also led a team of perceptual psychologists to provide principled approaches to virtual reality system calibration and the design of comfortable user experiences. He is also Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois. He has worked in robotics for over 20 years and is known for his introduction of the Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRTs) algorithm of motion planning and his book, Planning Algorithms.
