# MoveIt 2 Source Build - Linux

Installing MoveIt 2 from source is the first step in contributing new features, optimizations, and bug fixes back to the open source project. Thanks for getting involved!

<img class="docker-img" src="/assets/install_page/docker-illustration.png"/>

MoveIt is mainly supported on Linux, and the following build instructions support in particular:

- Ubuntu 22.04 / ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill (Recommended LTS)
- Ubuntu 22.04 / ROS 2 Iron Irwini (Recommended Stable)
- Ubuntu 22.04 / ROS 2 Rolling Ridley (Continuously Updated. Use this to access latest features.)

In the future, we would like to expand our source build instructions to more OS's, please contribute instruction write-ups to [this repo](https://github.com/moveit/moveit.ros.org).

These instructions assume you are running on Ubuntu 22.04 (Humble, Iron, Rolling)

## Prerequisites

### Install <img src="/assets/install_page/ros_logo.jpeg"/>

Install ROS 2 [Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html), [Iron](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html), or [Rolling](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html) following the installation instructions.

We recommend Humble for stable latest LTS distribution needs, Iron for latest stable release, and Rolling for contributing to MoveIt 2. Currently the [main branch](https://github.com/moveit/moveit2) supports Rolling, Iron, and Humble. However, since it's used for latest development, the main branch is unstable. For stable versions, please use the distro branches [humble](https://github.com/moveit/moveit2/tree/humble), or [iron](https://github.com/moveit/moveit2/tree/iron).

MoveIt2 source installation requires various other tools apart from what is already mentioned in the ROS2 install docs.

    sudo apt install -y \
      build-essential \
      cmake \
      git \
      python3-colcon-common-extensions \
      python3-flake8 \
      python3-rosdep \
      python3-setuptools \
      python3-vcstool \
      wget

Make sure you have the latest versions of packages installed:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt dist-upgrade
    rosdep update

Finally, don't forget to source the setup script.

    source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash

### Uninstall Any Pre-existing MoveIt Debians

In ROS2, debians conflict with packages built from source. So, remove any existing MoveIt debians:

    sudo apt remove ros-$ROS_DISTRO-moveit*

### Create Workspace and Source

Create a colcon workspace:

    export COLCON_WS=~/ws_moveit2/
    mkdir -p $COLCON_WS/src
    cd $COLCON_WS/src

## Download Source Code

Download the repository and install any dependencies. Issue the relevant commands for your ROS distribution.

### Humble, Iron -stable

    git clone https://github.com/moveit/moveit2.git -b $ROS_DISTRO
    for repo in moveit2/moveit2.repos $(f="moveit2/moveit2_$ROS_DISTRO.repos"; test -r $f && echo $f); do vcs import < "$repo"; done
    rosdep install -r --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO -y

### Rolling, Iron, Humble -unstable

    git clone https://github.com/moveit/moveit2.git -b main
    for repo in moveit2/moveit2.repos $(f="moveit2/moveit2_$ROS_DISTRO.repos"; test -r $f && echo $f); do vcs import < "$repo"; done
    rosdep install -r --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO -y

## Middleware

We recommend CycloneDDS as a middleware. Note: this makes all nodes started using this RMW incompatible with any other nodes not using Cyclone DDS.

    sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp
    export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp

You may want to add `export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp` to your ~/.bashrc to source it automatically.

## Build MoveIt

The rest of the commands are same for every distribution.

Configure and build the workspace:

    cd $COLCON_WS
    colcon build --event-handlers desktop_notification- status- --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

### Source the Colcon Workspace

Setup your environment - you can do this every time you work with this particular source install of the code, or you can add this to your ``.bashrc`` (recommended):

    source $COLCON_WS/install/setup.bash
