## Description

World MoveIt! Day is an international hackathon to improve the MoveIt! code base, documentation, and community. Following the heels of the repo merge, we hope to fix all broken links in the documentation, close as many longstanding pull requests and issues as possible, and have some fun with a newly released integrated simulation of MoveIt! manipulation + Gazebo + Fetch for us to test. An hour long Question and Answer session is scheduled at [9am Pacific](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?iso=20160823&p1=37&p2=224) to allow the community to meet the people merging their pull requests.

## Event Location Details

Fetch Robotics will be sponsoring an event with food, several robots to play with, and several in house engineers to help with the hackathon.

ROS Industrial at Southwest Research Institute will be hosting an event on their campus.

The Xamla Robotics Team at Provisio GmbH in Münster, Germany will be hosting an event with food, soft drinks, and a UR5 for testing.

If you aren't near an organized event we encourage you to have your own event in your lab/organization/company and video conference in to all the other events. We would also like to mail your team or event some MoveIt! stickers to schwag out your robots with. State your intent to join on [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/vCIKiWcAgaB4mASk2).

## Logistics

### Finding Where You Can Help

All suggested areas for improvement will be tracked on the new unified moveit repo and the "Assignee" meta data will be used to track issues that [need someone to tackle them](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee). The label [simple improvements](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+label%3A%22simple+improvements%22) will be used to indicate the issue can probably be tackled in less than a few hours, and the label [documentation](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation+no%3Aassignee) will be used for suggested tutorials, changes to the website, etc. Both labels are ideal for a World MoveIt! Day project.

If you would like to help the MoveIt! project by tackling an issue, assign yourself as the "Assignee" in the right side column so we know that you are working on it. Feel free to ask further questions in each issue's comments.

If you have ideas and improvements for the project, feel free to add your own issues to the tracker, using the "simple improvements" label if applicable. If you want to claim them for yourself, just immediately assign them to your username.


### Documentation

Improving our documentation is a major goal of WMD - please add to our Sphynx and Markdown-based documentation within our packages and on the MoveIt! website. If you have studied extensively an aspect of MoveIt! that is not currently documented, please convert your notes into a pull request in the appropriate location. If you've started a conversation on the mailing list or other location where a more experienced developer explained a concept, consider converting that answer into a pull request to help others in the future with the same question.

For more details on modifying documentation, see [Contributing](http://moveit.ros.org/documentation/contributing/).

### Video Conference

We will use Google Hangouts for the video conferencing software. Note that Google's video chat software is limited to 25 participants.

### MoveIt! Integrated Manipulation Simulation

One of the objectives of WMD is to resurrect an end-to-end simulation of a robot performing pick-and-place using perception, MoveIt!, and Gazebo - similar to the no longer supported [PR2 Tabletop Manipulation pipeline for ROS Fuerte](http://wiki.ros.org/pr2_tabletop_manipulation_apps). Fetch robotics will be providing a solution for on this day for testing. More info TBD.
