## Description

World MoveIt! Day is an international hackathon to improve the MoveIt! code base, documentation, and community. We hope to close as many pull requests and issues as possible and explore new areas of features and improvements for the now five year old framework. A video feed will unite the various locations and enable more collaboration.

## Event Location Details

**Verb Surgical** will be hosting an event with lunch and in house engineers to help with the hackathon. Fetch Robotics will provide a Fetch robot to test MoveIt! on. Please signup on [on this form](https://goo.gl/forms/Luia41ONpu1T0JJp2). An NDA will be required before entering the building.

**Magazino** will be hosting an event with food and a UR5

**ROS Industrial at Southwest Research Institute** will be hosting an event on the SwRI campus in their new robotics lab in building 68. For details and to signup see [EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/world-moveit-day-san-antonio-tickets-38599423916)

**The Xamla Robotics Team at Provisio GmbH** in Münster, Germany will be hosting an event with food, soft drinks, and a UR5 for testing

**ROS-Industrial Asian Pacific Consortium** EVENT ON THURSDAY OCTOBER 19th due to a national holiday. Lunch will be provided. To register and obtain the video conference details please sign up here: [EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/world-moveit-day-asia-pacific-tickets-38378316578).

If you aren't near an organized event we encourage you to have your own event in your lab/organization/company and video conference in to all the other events. We would also like to mail your team or event some MoveIt! stickers to schwag out your robots with. State your intent to join [on this form](https://goo.gl/forms/Luia41ONpu1T0JJp2).

## Logistics

### What version of MoveIt! should you use?

We recommend the Kinetic LTS branch/release. The Lunar release is simply a copy of the Kinetic branch (it is not forked yet) and the Indigo branch is considered "stable" and only bug fixes should be backported.

### Finding Where You Can Help

Suggested areas for improvement will be tracked on the new unified moveit repo via several labels that are ideal for World MoveIt! Day:

- [simple improvements](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+-label%3Aassigned+label%3A%22simple+improvements%22) indicates the issue can probably be tackled in less than a few hours.
- [documentation](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Adocumentation%20-label%3Aassigned%20) suggestes new tutorials, changes to the website, etc.
- [assigned](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aassigned) aids developers to find issues that are not already being worked on.
- **no label** - even issues that are not marked as "simple" can be worked on for World MoveIt! day, though they will likely take longer than one day to compelete

If you would like to help the MoveIt! project by tackling an issue, claim the issue by commenting "I'll work on this" and a maintainer will then hopefully add the label "assigned". Feel free to ask further questions in each issue's comments.

If you have ideas and improvements for the project, please add your own issues to the tracker, using the "simple improvements" label if applicable. Its fine if you want to then claim them for yourself.

### Documentation

Improving our documentation is a major goal of WMD - please add to our Sphynx and Markdown-based documentation within our packages and on the MoveIt! website. If you have studied extensively an aspect of MoveIt! that is not currently documented, please convert your notes into a pull request in the appropriate location. If you've started a conversation on the mailing list or other location where a more experienced developer explained a concept, consider converting that answer into a pull request to help others in the future with the same question.

For more details on modifying documentation, see [Contributing](http://moveit.ros.org/documentation/contributing/).
