## Date

  * **October 18th, 2017**
  * See specific locations for details on times. 
  * Note that the Tokyo and Singapore locations will have their event on the 19th

## Description

World MoveIt! Day is an international hackathon to improve the MoveIt! code base, documentation, and community. We hope to close as many pull requests and issues as possible and explore new areas of features and improvements for the now five year old framework. Everyone is welcome to participate from their local workplace, simply by working on open issues. In addition, a number of companies and groups host meetings on their sites all over the world. A video feed will unite the various locations and enable more collaboration. Maintainers will take part in some of these locations.

## Logistics

### What version of MoveIt! should you use?

We recommend the Kinetic LTS branch/release. The Lunar release is simply a copy of the Kinetic branch (it is not forked yet) and the Indigo branch is considered "stable" - only ABI/API-stable changes will be backported.

### Finding Where You Can Help

Suggested areas for improvement are tracked on the new unified moveit repo via several labels:

- [moveit day candidate](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/labels/moveit%20day%20candidate) labels issues as possible entry points for participants in the event. This list will grow longer before the event.
- [simple improvements](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+-label%3Aassigned+label%3A%22simple+improvements%22) indicates the issue can probably be tackled in a few hours.
- [documentation](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Adocumentation%20-label%3Aassigned%20) suggests new tutorials, changes to the website, etc.
- [assigned](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aassigned) aids developers to find issues that are not already being worked on.
- **no label** - of course issues that are not marked can still be worked on during World MoveIt! day, though they will likely take longer than one day to complete.

If you would like to help the MoveIt! project by tackling an issue, claim the issue by commenting "I'll work on this" and a maintainer will then hopefully add the label "assigned". Feel free to ask further questions in each issue's comments.

If you have ideas and improvements for the project, please add your own issues to the tracker, using the appropriate labels where applicable. It's fine if you want to then claim them for yourself.

Further needs for documentation and tutorials improvement can be found directly on the [moveit_tutorials issue tracker](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_tutorials/issues).

Other larger code sprint ideas can be found [on this page](http://moveit.ros.org/documentation/contributing/future_projects/). While they will take longer than a day the ideas might provide a good reference for other things to contribute on WMD.

### Documentation

Improving our documentation is a major goal of WMD - please add to our Sphynx and Markdown-based documentation within our packages and on the MoveIt! website. If you have studied extensively an aspect of MoveIt! that is not currently documented, please convert your notes into a pull request in the appropriate location. If you've started a conversation on the mailing list or other location where a more experienced developer explained a concept, consider converting that answer into a pull request to help others in the future with the same question.

For more details on modifying documentation, see [Contributing](http://moveit.ros.org/documentation/contributing/).

### Video Conference and IRC

Join the conversation on IRC with #moveit at irc.freenode.net. For those new to IRC try [this web client](https://webchat.freenode.net).
