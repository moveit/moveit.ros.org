MoveIt is excited to announce its participation in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2023 as a mentoring organization.
This is a rare opportunity for students to get paid for contributing to an open-source project, gaining hands-on experience, and receiving mentorship from experts in the field.
For more details about the program, visit the [Google Summer of Code website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

Contributor proposal applications for GSoC 2023 opened today, and the deadline is April 4th.
We have prepared a [list of project ideas for 2023 which you can find here](https://moveit.ros.org/events/2023-google-summer-of-code/).
These projects cover various aspects of MoveIt, including motion planning, benchmarking, collision checking, and more.
If you have your own project idea, feel free to create a pull request on the repository for this page.

To be eligible, you should have experience with ROS and, ideally, prior exposure to MoveIt.
Most projects require C++ programming skills.
Projects are available in two sizes: medium (175 hours) and large (350 hours).

To increase your chances of a successful GSoC application, we recommend the following:

- Creating at least one pull request to MoveIt and including a reference to it in your application
- Being specific in describing your experience, pointing us to code you've written and contributed
- Describing your background and experience in robotics and ROS
- Telling us what you hope to get out of the Summer of Code experience

Take advantage of this opportunity to contribute to MoveIt and advance your robotics and software development skills.
Make sure to submit your proposal before the April 4th deadline. Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your applications!
