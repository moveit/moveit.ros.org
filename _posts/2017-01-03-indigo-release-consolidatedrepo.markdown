title: First MoveIt! release in 2017 into ROS Indigo
description: First update for Indigo since 6 months ago including many features.
categories:
- MoveIt!
- ROS
---

We are happy to announce that a lot of improvements are now released into MoveIt! on ROS [Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo) LTS (Long Term Support)! It's been 6 months since the last release into Indigo back in June 2016.

During this time, MoveIt! maintenance has been refurbished and we now [consolidated development repositories](https://github.com/moveit/moveit) of many packages whose repos were previously separated. For ROS [Jade](http://moveit.ros.org/moveit!/ros/2016/09/02/firstjaderelease.html) and [Kinetic](http://moveit.ros.org/moveit!/ros/2016/12/15/firstkineticrelease.html) MoveIt! has been already released from this single repo, and Indigo finally made a new release out from the same single repo.

Change to installation
----------------------

You can install the binaries of all the basic libraries by a single line of command without specifying many packages:

```
$ apt-get install ros-indigo-moveit
```

  NOTE that `ros-indigo-moveit-full` is temporarily gone. It'll be back again upon the next public sync (cf. [previous public sync announcement](https://discourse.ros.org/t/new-packages-for-indigo-2016-12-28/1039/2)).

If you want to build MoveIt! from source instead of binaries, then simply clone the single repo:

```
$ cd %YOUR_CATKIN_WS%/src
$ git clone https://github.com/moveit/moveit.git   (http)
$ git clone git@github.com:moveit/moveit.git       (ssh)
```

For more info about installation, check the tutorial [moveit.ros.org/install](http://moveit.ros.org/install/).

Things you should know
----------------------

* **Rebuild your full (moveit-related) workspace** or you might experience problems.
  There have been some (mostly internal) binary-incompatible changes for speedup and safety.

* **Make sure you have the new version of all relevant moveit packages.**
  Because of reorganization of the development process and the package structure, you might find your system omitted some packages when installing updates in ubuntu.
  Updating them explicitly should work though.

* **The move_group node loads all core-plugins implicitly.**
  If you notice unwanted services/actions, you can disable these explicitly in your `move_group.launch`.
  [The change to our `move_group.launch` template](https://github.com/moveit/moveit/pull/359/files#diff-738c7ef082dc116580b8bb77c1b20e26) illustrates the changed interface.

* **"Invalid Trajectory: start point deviates from current robot state more than ..."**
  MoveIt 0.7.3+ ensures that the start state of the robot is near the current state before executing a trajectory.
  The check might be violated if the noise in your JointStates exceeds the default threshold value of 0.01 per joint even if your robot did not move between planning and execution.
  In this case you can increase the threshold value in the ros parameter `/move_group/trajectory_execution/allowed_start_tolerance` - or disable the check by setting it to 0.0

* **MoveIt 0.7.5+ provides libraries called `libmoveit*.so.0.7.3`.**
  This version suffix is called an SONAME and (in MoveIt indigo) indicates the last version that broke binary compatibility.

Changelog
---------

Among many changes added since the last Indigo release, some notable ones are listed as follows. Because the new feature development is mainly now happening for ROS Kinetic (as mentioned upon the latest [Kinetic release](http://moveit.ros.org/moveit!/ros/2016/12/15/firstkineticrelease.html)), some changes are only available in newer ROS distros and thus unavailable in Indigo mainly due to the following reasons:

- unmet dependency
- ABI brekage (it is avoided as much as possible, desite exceptional cases)

The table below aims to better visualize the available changes recently introduced into MoveIt! among ROS distros.
