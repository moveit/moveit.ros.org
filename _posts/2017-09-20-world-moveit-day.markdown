![World MoveIt! Day]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/world_moveit_day_2017.png)

We're excited to announce that this year's "World MoveIt! Day" will be Wednesday October 18th! The event is a day long international hackathon to improve the MoveIt! code base, documentation, and community. We hope to close as many pull requests and issues as possible and explore new areas of features and improvements for the now five year old framework.

We will be having several event locations including:

- [Verb Surgical](http://www.verbsurgical.com/), San Francisco Bay Area. Lunch and in house engineers will help with the hackathon.
- [Magazino](https://www.magazino.eu/), Munich, Germany.
- [Southwest Research Institute](http://www.swri.org/ros-industrial), San Antonio, USA
- [Xamla Robotics (PROVISIO GmbH)](http://xamla.com/en/), Münster, Germany

You are encouraged to have your own event in your lab/organization/company and video conference in to all the other events.  Please let us know your intention to join [here](https://goo.gl/forms/Luia41ONpu1T0JJp2). More details coming soon!
