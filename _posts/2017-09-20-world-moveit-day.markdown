We're excited to announce that this year's [World MoveIt! Day](/events/world-moveit-day-2017/) will be Wednesday October 18th! The event is a day long international hackathon to improve the MoveIt! code base, documentation, and community. We hope to close as many pull requests and issues as possible and explore new areas of features and improvements for the now five year old framework.

We will be having several event locations including:

- [Verb Surgical](http://www.verbsurgical.com/), San Francisco Bay Area
- [Magazino](https://www.magazino.eu/), Munich, Germany
- [Southwest Research Institute](http://www.swri.org/ros-industrial), San Antonio, USA
- [Xamla Robotics (PROVISIO GmbH)](http://xamla.com/en/), Münster, Germany
- [ROS-Industrial Asian Pacific Consortium](http://rosindustrial.org/ric-apac/), Singapore (THURSDAY OCTOBER 19th)
