We are excited to announce our release for Rolling and Humble, version 2.5.2. With MoveIt’s latest version bumping to 2.5.2, we’ve finally added support for the long-awaited MoveIt Setup Assistant on Humble and Rolling. Besides bug fixes, to sum up the new 86 seperate commits, this release includes:

* Full sync with MoveIt 1 ([moveit2#1402](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/pull/1402)): MoveIt 2 now includes all the latest bug fixes MoveIt 1 has.
* Port MoveIt Setup Assistant ([moveit2#1254](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/pull/1254)): Featuring a full rewrite using pluginlib, MSA is now more modular than ever and ready to setup your custom ROS 2 robots!
* Remove most of the boost usage ([moveit2#1372](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/pull/1372) and [moveit2#1331](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/pull/1331)): A big step towards removing boost dependency and use equivalents from the standard library
* Remove unnecessary rclcpp headers ([moveit2#1333](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/pull/1333)): A huge improvement on the compile time
* Port OMPL Constraints ([moveit2#1273](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/pull/1273)): Also featuring a new [how-to tutorial](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/how_to_guides/using_ompl_constrained_planning/ompl_constrained_planning.html)!
