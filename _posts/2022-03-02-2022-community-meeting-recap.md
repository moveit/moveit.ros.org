On February 24 2022 the third MoveIt Community Meeting took place. Previous community meetings were held in [2015](/moveit!/ros/2015/09/17/moveit-community.html) and [2016](/moveit!/ros/2016/11/01/moveit-community.html), so we were long overdue for another one! The event was attended by about 65 people from all over the world. We had presenters from industry and academia. The [event page](/events/2022-moveit-community-meeting/) has been updated with links to videos for each of the six presentations. If you want to watch all these talks back-to-back, you can watch [this playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMoF26C2zJk&list=PL2V08eX0CdgCdgLubnlqzQiO6mBNqFmTm). There were also four lightning talks. Links to videos for each of these lightning talks can be found on the [event page](/events/2022-moveit-community-meeting/) as well.
