MoveIt has been accepted again as a mentoring organization for the Google Summer of Code! Details about the program can be found [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/). Ideas for possible projects are listed [here](/events/2022-google-summer-of-code/). If you are a student who enjoys working on MoveIt, this is your chance. At a minimum, you should have experience with ROS. Ideally, you have also worked with MoveIt before. Almost all projects require experience with programming in C++.

Now is the time to discuss your interest in a particular project on [Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/c/moveit) or, when appropriate, on [Github](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit.ros.org). I highly recommend to engage with the MoveIt community on Discourse *before* submitting an application. Make sure to look at [our tips for successful GSoC applications](/events/2022-google-summer-of-code/#tips-for-writing-a-successful-google-summer-of-code-application-for-moveit).
