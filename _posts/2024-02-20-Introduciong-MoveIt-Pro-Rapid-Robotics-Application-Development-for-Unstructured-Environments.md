We are excited to announce MoveIt Pro, a new name for our flagship product. Previously known as MoveIt Studio, we are changing the product’s name to MoveIt Pro to better align with the capabilities and value that MoveIt Pro delivers.

Since its launch in 2021, MoveIt Pro’s capabilities have grown even more expansive than our easy-to-use user interface and powerful behavior tree builder that MoveIt Pro  is known for.  We’ve   been rapidly enhancing our commercial-grade robotics runtime engine to further accelerate the development of solutions to real-world, unstructured robotics challenges. With so many features under the hood, the professional tool has outgrown the original MoveIt Studio name.

We’ve made changes to clarify the UI and runtime functions clearly, the MoveIt Studio name now represents the high-level robotics programming environment while a new MoveIt Runtime product will contain our advanced robotics engine and developer tools.
