Greetings ROS Community,

We're pleased to announce we will holding our second annual MoveItCon event the day after ROSCon, Tuesday November 17th, 2020 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Last year's event, more modestly called the MoveIt Workshop 2019, was a great success with over 60 registered attendees.

We'll be following up with more event details and sponsorship opportunities. Please contact us with any questions: [moveitcon@picknik.ai](mailto:moveitcon@picknik.ai)
