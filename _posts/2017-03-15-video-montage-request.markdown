Join us in celebrating [5 years](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/commit/206e93c555a6ddcdbe826809c30b90b89bbb52d8) of MoveIt! by contributing your robot video clips to create a video montage! We are combining our call for videos with ROS-Industrial to save you and us effort, but if you are not involved with ROS-Industrial you are still strongly encouraged to submit your videos also.

Submit your clips here: [http://rosindustrial.org/video-submission](http://rosindustrial.org/video-submission)
