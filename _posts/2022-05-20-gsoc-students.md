The MoveIt project is excited to announce that MoveIt was awarded 2 slots for the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC) program. GSoC is an international program in which Google awards stipends to students who complete a free and open-source software coding project during the summer.

[Peter David Fagan](https://peterdavidfagan.com) will be working on creating Python bindings for MoveIt 2. Peter previously worked on robotics at Autodesk and will start his PhD studies in robotics and autonomous systems in the Fall. He will be mentored by Henning Kayser, chief MoveIt architect at [PickNik Robotics](https://picknik.ai/), and [Michael Görner](https://tams.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/people/goerner/), MoveIt maintainer and robotics PhD student at the University of Hamburg.

[Cristian Beltran-Hernandez](https://cristianbehe.me) will be working on simultaneous trajectory execution, something he has already worked on as part of the [World Robot Summit 2020 Industrial Assembly Challenge](https://wrs.nedo.go.jp/en/wrs2020/challenge/industrial/assembly.html) competition. Cristian is currently finishing up his PhD at Osaka University in Japan. He will be mentored by Simon Schmeißer, a MoveIt maintainer who works as a software engineer on robotics and 3D vision at [Optonic](https://www.optonic.com). Henning Kayser and Michael Görner will co-mentor Cristian.
