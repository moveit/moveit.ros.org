 [Zak Kingston](https://github.com/zkingston) presented at the 2022 MoveIt Community Meeting on how RoboFlex and MoveIt work together. Zak is a postdoctoral research associate and lab manager for the Kavraki Lab at Rice University under the direction of Dr. Lydia Kavraki. He graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rice in December 2021. His research interests lie in algorithmic robotics, focusing on robot manipulation planning and planning with constraints.

 Zak's work on Robowflex, a high-level C++ library for MoveIt, is now available [here](https://github.com/KavrakiLab/robowflex)! Robowflex makes using MoveIt simple and has been used in a number of publications. Take a look at the associated paper and documentation online.
