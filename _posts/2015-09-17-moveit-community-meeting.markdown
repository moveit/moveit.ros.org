Thank you for coming to the MoveIt! Community Meeting and thanks to the presenters for making this a huge success. There were more than 240 people registered and more than 150 who attended from all over the world. I apologize to those running Ubuntu who had issues joining us (using Chrome was the suggested solution for the future).

Thanks to all the presenters for the great talks:

* The State of MoveIt! - Sachin Chitta (Stealth Startup)
* OMPL - Mark Moll, Lydia Kavraki (Rice University)
* ROS-Control - Adolfo Rodríguez Tsouroukdissian (PAL Robotics)
* Updates to STOMP - Jorge Nicho (SwRI)
* MoveIt! based implementation of an I-AUV - Dina Youakim (University of Girona)
* Team VIGIR at the DRC - Stefan Kohlbrecher (Technische Universität Darmstadt)
* ROS 2.0 and Manipulation - Jackie Kay (OSRF)
