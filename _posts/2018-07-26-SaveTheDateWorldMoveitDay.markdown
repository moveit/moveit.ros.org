**Save the Date: World MoveIt! Day 2018**

We’re excited to announce that this year’s World MoveIt! Day will be Thursday, October 25, 2018! The event is a day long international hackathon to improve the MoveIt! code base, documentation, and community. We hope to close as many pull requests and issues as possible and explore new areas of features and improvements building off of six years of dedicated work.
We will be having several international event locations including:

- [Fraunhofer IPA](https://www.ipa.fraunhofer.de/en.html) / [RIC-EU](https://rosindustrial.org/ric-eu/), Stuttgart, Germany
- [ROS-Industrial Asian Pacific Consortium](http://rosindustrial.org/ric-apac/), Singapore
- [Tokyo Opensource Robotics Kyokai Association (TORK)](http://opensource-robotics.tokyo.jp/), Kashiwa, Japan
(held on Friday, October 26!)
- [Southwest Research Institute](https://www.swri.org/), San Antonio, USA

Beyond these event locations, you are encouraged to have your own event in your lab/organization/company and video conference into all the other events.
