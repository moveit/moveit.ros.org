[Tiffany Cappellari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiffany-cappellari-199174149/) from [Southwest Research Institute](https://www.swri.org/) - MoveIt for Aerospace Automation Tasks

Tiffany Cappellari provides a practitioner's perspective on how to include complex motion constraints into MoveIt's motion planning pipeline, as motivated by applications in aerospace automation. The lessons learned are transferrable to many other practically useful scenarios.
