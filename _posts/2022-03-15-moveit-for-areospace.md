[Tiffany Cappellari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiffany-cappellari-199174149/) from [Southwest Research Institute](https://www.swri.org/) provides a practitioner's perspective on how to include complex motion constraints into MoveIt's motion planning pipeline, as motivated by applications in aerospace automation. The lessons reviewed in her talk are transferrable to other industrial sectors.
