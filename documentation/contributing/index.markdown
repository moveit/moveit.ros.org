    <h3>Answer User Questions</h3>
    <p>
      You can contribute greatly to the MoveIt community by answering other people‚Äôs questions on the <a href="https://answers.ros.org/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:moveit/page:1/" target="_blank">answers.ros.org</a>, ROS community‚Äôs official question-answer forum. Please feel free help answer questions there, and gain Karma in the process!
    </p>
    <p class="second-paragraph">
      You don't need to know everything in MoveIt to be helpful to others. Any amount of experience can be helpful. To really get involved, here's how to setup an email alert for ROS Answers to track the &lt;moveit&gt; tag.

    <h3>Enhancing Documentation</h3>
    <p>
      Our documentation is of course open source and we strongly encourage you to improve it as you learn MoveIt yourself and find mistakes. ‚ú® It lives in three different repos on Github:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/moveit/moveit2_tutorials" target="_blank">https://github.com/moveit/moveit2_tutorials</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/moveit/moveit_tutorials" target="_blank">https://github.com/moveit/moveit_tutorials</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/moveit/moveit.ros.org" target="_blank">https://github.com/moveit/moveit.ros.org</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="second-paragraph">
      You can edit the contents directly through the Github website or by using ``git clone`` to edit it locally on your computer. Enhancing documentation makes you a hero among heroes.üòª

    <h3>Add New Features</h3>
    <p>
      We are continually evolving MoveIt and new features are always encouraged. However, to keep up the stability and code quality of the project, we ask you keep your pull requests in the smallest digestible chunks possible (not thousands of lines of changed code).
    </p>
    <p class="second-paragraph">
      If you're unsure if your new feature is a good idea, you are encouraged to open an issue or post on Discourse first explaining your proposed change, and request feedback from the community.
