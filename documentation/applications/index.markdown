# MoveIt Applications

There are many diverse application examples of what you can use MoveIt for. The list below demonstrates some of the advanced applications developed on MoveIt. You can have fun by trying the applications, which may help you figure out how to fit different features together. If you are interested, you can visit [MoveIt Tutorials](https://moveit.picknik.ai/) for further technical details. At the same time, your contribution is encouraged, no matter the application is developed for some usages, competitions or research topics, or to demonstrate the newly developed MoveIt feature.

## MoveIt Example Apps

Some advanced MoveIt applications with full robotic setups can be found in [moveit_example_apps](https://github.com/moveit/moveit_example_apps). If you have an awesome application using MoveIt, and you would like to share it with others, consider contributing it to this project with a tutorial detailing how to build and launch your application.

## MoveIt Pro

PickNik Robotics offers the commercial-grade [MoveIt Pro](https://picknik.ai/pro/) runtime and developer platform. Build on the foundation of the open-source codebase, MoveIt Pro enables commercial deployments of robots in unstructured environments faster and more reliable to ship to production. MoveIt Pro has been used to create challenging applications like:

### Complex Task Sequencing for Material Handling

- [Team NAIST-Panasonic at the Amazon Robotics Challenge 2017](https://github.com/warehouse-picking-automation-challenges/team_naist_panasonic). Single robot arm performing pick-and-place with recognition. Uses MoveIt for motion primitives and kinematic checks and the robot's internal IK for linear motions.
