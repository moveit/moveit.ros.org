# MoveIt Applications

There are many diverse application examples of what you can use MoveIt for. The list below demonstrates some of the advanced applications developed on MoveIt. You can have fun by trying the applications, which may help you figure out how to fit different features together. If you are interested, you can visit [MoveIt Tutorials](http://moveit2_tutorials.picknik.ai/) for further technical details. At the same time, your contribution is encouraged, no matter the application is developed for some usages, competitions or research topics, or to demonstrate the newly developed MoveIt feature.

## MoveIt Example Apps

Some advanced MoveIt applications with full robotic setups can be found in [moveit_example_apps](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_example_apps). If you have an awesome application using MoveIt, and you would like to share it with others, consider contributing it to this project with a tutorial detailing how to build and launch your application.

## Other Application Resources

If you have a large open source project using MoveIt, you can share the project links here:

- [Team O2AC at the World Robot Summit Assembly Challenge 2020](https://github.com/o2ac/o2ac-ur/). 2 robot arms assembling a drive unit using Robotiq grippers. Extensive Python examples for synchronous, independent and simultaneous motions.

- [Team NAIST-Panasonic at the Amazon Robotics Challenge 2017](https://github.com/warehouse-picking-automation-challenges/team_naist_panasonic). Single robot arm performing pick-and-place with recognition. Uses MoveIt for motion primitives and kinematic checks and the robot's internal IK for linear motions.
